At Objex Inc., I started as a UI/UX Engineer, redesigning their websites. I got promoted to full stack developer on
Rabbito.io, a microblogging platform, handling everything from design to making it work. For rabbito, I built a
blogging system, made a desktop editor for writing blogs in markdown, and created a user-friendly dashboard for
managing blogs and posts.
