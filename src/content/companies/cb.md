Although my specialization is in frontend development, I have worn multiple hats across frontend, backend, product
design, and DevOps. When I joined CB, it was a product company. I led the refactoring of Hirecinch, a CB product, which resulted
in a 40% reduction in engineering costs. Later, as CB pivoted to a services model, I had the opportunity to work on
projects ranging from Silicon Valley startups to established companies with $10M+ in revenue.
