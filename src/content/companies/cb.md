At CB I quickly became a leading voices for accessibility and developer experience. I proposed some major
architectural changes in hirecinch, a product at CB, including shifting from react-redux to SWR, making
use of uncontrolled input wherever possible, optimized re-redeners. I also worked as solo developer on
multiple projects. See my projects for more detail.
