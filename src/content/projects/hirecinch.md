My Primary role in this project was frontend development but till now I have worked as frontend, backend and product design role in this project. As a backend devleoper I had worked on referal discounts features which involved 2rd party integration with stripe. As Product designer I have worked on a feature of automatic candidates screening based. As a frontend developer I had done some major refactoring work which resulted in 25% velocity gain for the whole team. During this refactoring process I worked closes with product designers to converge on more structured design system.
