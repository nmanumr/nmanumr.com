I'm not that good at icons/logos designing but I was always inspired by designs so I decided to
push my boundaries. Following are some icons that unexpectedly turned out to be great:

<hr class="!mb-4" />

<img
  class="border-gray-200 hidden rounded-md border sm:float-right sm:ml-4 sm:mt-10 sm:block"
  src="/images/gwbasic.net.png"
  alt="GwBasic Logo"
/>

<ProjectInfo title="GwBasic.net" subtitle="June 2016" />

<img
  class="border-gray-200 mx-auto block rounded-md border sm:hidden"
  src="/images/gwbasic.net.png"
  alt="GwBasic Logo"
/>

This was probably the first logo that at least looked good after the 'N' logo
(the same logo used in the header of this site). I had Photoshop and Illustrator craze at that time
although, I couldn't understand most of the things going on especially Illustrator. So, it was
designed in photoshop. I also designed the [splash screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmanumr/gwbasic.net/master/GwBasic.Net/Resources/splash2.png) of this project, for which I was
just sleeping the thread for some amount of time before loading the actual app. ;)

<img
  class="border-gray-200 hidden rounded-md border sm:float-right sm:ml-4 sm:mt-10 sm:block"
  src="/images/x-logo.png"
  alt="X Logo"
/>

<ProjectInfo title="BlackArcX Logos" subtitle="January 2020" />

<img
  class="border-gray-200 mx-auto block rounded-md border sm:hidden"
  src="/images/x-logo.png"
  alt="X Logo"
/>

BlackArcX is a hypothetical company that I with my friend ([@ameerhmzx](https://github.com/ameerhmzx)) fantasized about. For this we came
up with an idea to start with a 3x3 grid of dots and connections can be made with a fluid-like stripe.
And in fact, we drew all the alphabets on this grid. Following are few of them:

<div class="mt-10 grid grid-cols-3 gap-x-4 gap-y-4 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-5">
  <img
    class="border-gray-200 !my-0 mx-auto h-auto w-24 rounded-md border"
    src="/images/a-logo.png"
    alt="A Logo"
  />
  <img
    class="border-gray-200 !my-0 mx-auto h-auto w-24 rounded-md border"
    src="/images/n-logo3.png"
    alt="N Logo"
  />
  <img
    class="border-gray-200 !my-0 mx-auto h-auto w-24 rounded-md border"
    src="/images/v-logo.png"
    alt="V Logo"
  />
  <img
    class="border-gray-200 !my-0 mx-auto h-auto w-24 rounded-md border"
    src="/images/s-logo.png"
    alt="S Logo"
  />
  <img
    class="border-gray-200 !my-0 mx-auto h-auto w-24 rounded-md border"
    src="/images/w-logo.png"
    alt="W Logo"
  />
</div>

Exosoft is a software house. For them, I drew my very first interactive SVG logo for them. I couldn't
come up with a shape that sounds like exosoft, eventually, I drew this abstract shape but, they actually
liked it. I also helped build their [website](https://exosoft.io/)
(not sure if it's still up or not :D).

While drawing this logo I learned how difficult it is not to draw seemingly simple shapes.
Also, I learned a trick to animate stroke length.

D-Square aka Data Drive is also a software house. I just redrew their logo picked a font pair and also
designed their job advertisement and also an HTML page for the [jobs section](https://jobs.dsquare.io/).

MPVIRG stands for Machine Perception & Visual Intelligence Research Group. This research was led by
our final year project supervisor and they also had a website for the sole purpose of sharing all the
projects and researches. They also had an existing logo, one day was just looking at their logo and I
decided to redesign it so, I just did it. It's still not being used on the actual site.

Along with the actual logo I also took inspiration from
[Nigel Standford's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPhq7iR65k0gWcraXgLiY1A) music video of
[Automatica](https://youtu.be/bAdqazixuRY?t=225). BTW he produces great music if you haven't heard
him check out his [CYMATICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3oItpVa9fs).

When you can draw few logos etc you have to draw logos for your friends and family members too.
And yes, I did this too. I infact was thinking of designing logos for all my friends so that in chat
all of the avatars can look consistent, kind of a branded friends group. But, here are few good ones:
